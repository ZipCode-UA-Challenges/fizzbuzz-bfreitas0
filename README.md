# FizzBuzz

## Description

FizzBuzz is a common coding interview challenge that requires the programmer to print numbers from 1 through n, but with specific replacements.

If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". If the number is divisible by

5, print "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

Each number or string should be followed by a newline character.

## Getting Started

> [!TIP]
> This repository comes with a preconfigured C++ devcontainer for usage in GitHub Codespaces

### Working in a Codespace

- Click `<> Code` -> `Codespaces` -> `Create codespace on main`
- Complete `src/FizzBuzz.cpp`
- Run the project

### Working Locally

- Clone the copied repo provided to you through the github classroom link
- Open the project in your editor of choice
- Complete `src/FizzBuzz.cpp`
- Run the project

## How to Run the Project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses cmake
